## Design Overview


## Design Details

Here is a graphical look at my design:

![This is cool, too bad you can't see it](online-shopping-uml-example.png "An initial UI")

made from [a tool that generates UML from existing code](http://staruml.io/).


## Design Considerations

* How the neighborhoods interact with other neighborhoods and how the neighborhoods' cells interact with each other.


## User Interface

Here is our amazing UI:

![sketch image](sketch_wireframe.jpg "UI Design")

Users can load in a file by clicking on Choose File button and picking their CSV file from the File
Dialog that pops up. The user can also click the top animation buttons to step through. In order from
left to right, the button's functionalities are as follows: reset to step 1, go back 1 step and pause, play
animation, pause, and go forward 1 step and pause.
